# Hi, I’m Sandra 👋

I am a PhD candidate in Medicine at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS), with a focus on computational drug discovery and molecular modeling.

My work integrates **molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, docking, and reproducible CADD pipelines** to study biologically relevant targets, particularly in the context of NAD metabolism.

## 🔬 Research Focus
- Molecular dynamics simulations for protein–ligand systems  
- Computational drug discovery (CADD) workflows  
- Target-focused studies on NAD metabolism (e.g., NNMT, NAPRT)  
- Automation and reproducibility in MD simulations  
- Exploratory work toward PROTAC design and ternary complex modeling 

---

## 🧰 Technical Stack
- MD Simulations: GROMACS, AMBER, CHARMM  
- HPC & Automation: SLURM job scheduling, workflow scripting  
- Analysis & Visualization: RMSD, RMSF, trajectory analysis, plotting  
- Docking & Scoring: GNINA, AutoDock and related tools  
- Operating Environments: Linux, HPC clusters

---

## 📁 What You’ll Find Here
This GitHub hosts:
- Reproducible SLURM-based MD simulation workflows  
- R scripts for MD trajectory analysis and publication-quality plots  
- Lightweight, modular scripts used in day-to-day computational research  
- Research sandboxes and notes for future method and pipeline development

Larger, standalone tools and pipelines will be added as they mature.
